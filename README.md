## 🛡️ **Project Overview**  
**AI-Powered Thief Detection** is a real-time security system that identifies **suspicious individuals & objects** using **Ultralytics YOLO & OpenCV**. It estimates:  

🔹 **Age, Gender, Height, Weight**  
🔹 **Surrounding Objects (Bags, Phones, etc.)**  
🔹 **Potential Threats (Weapons: Knives, Guns, etc.)**  

**No training required** – We use **pre-trained YOLO models** for instant results!

## 🔥 **Key Features**  

✅ **📷 Real-Time Person & Object Detection**  
✅ **🔍 Thief Identification & Attribute Prediction**  
✅ **⚠️ Weapon & Threat Detection (Guns, Knives, Swords, etc.)**  
✅ **🎥 Works with Images & Video Streams**

## 🎯 **Why is This Important?**  

🔍 **Enhanced Security** – Helps prevent crimes & thefts  
🏢 **Surveillance Integration** – Works with **CCTV cameras**  
📊 **Data-Driven Insights** – Provides security reports  
⚠️ **Threat Awareness** – Instantly detects **harmful objects**

## 🛠 **Technologies & Libraries Used**  

| 🔧 Technology  | 📌 Purpose |
|---------------|-----------|
| **[Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)** | Object & person detection |
| **OpenCV** | Image & video processing |
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **NumPy & Pandas** | Data handling |

## 🚀 **How It Works?**  

1️⃣ **👀 Detection:** YOLO detects **people, objects, and weapons**  
2️⃣ **🧠 Analysis:** AI estimates **age, gender, height, and weight**  
3️⃣ **⚠️ Threat Check:** Identifies **harmful objects** (weapons, bags, etc.)  
4️⃣ **🔔 Security Alerts:** (Can be integrated with notifications in the future)
